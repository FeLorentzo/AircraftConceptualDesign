## main.py

The backbone of the project. It runs all the others functions, in order, gives the plots and returns the interested values for the project.

## Functions

The tools of the project. Inside of that, we put the desirable files with useful functions to run the code.

## AircraftConceptualDesign_Colab.ipynb

Synthesyses all of the functions and explainings on code, using the UI of Google Collaboratory.
